          <p>Hi! I'm an 18-year-old from Pittsburgh, PA learning @ Stanford.</p1> 
          <p>I'm curious about <font color = "#3883FF"><b>why we feel like government doesn't work + what public sector solutions best solve for.</b></font> Basically, a mix of systems engineering / design thinking. I also really like looking at history archives & understanding Chinese-American solidarity. <p>
          <p>Right now, I research @ the <a href ="https://gardnercenter.stanford.edu">Gardner Center</a> to help evaluate mental health solutions in schools. This year, I want to <font color = "#3883FF"><b>learn data analysis & learn in public.</b></font></p>
          <p>Previously, I explored <a href ="https://stemandbuds.org">nonprofits</a> and <a href ="https://bit.ly/fromthegroundupguide">advocacy</a> spaces, which taught me that <font color = "#3883FF"><b>I care about social problems and cultural impact.</b></font> But then someone told me: most creating can only be sustainably done through the market or politics. Two different systems with two different incentives. This changed how I think about scale and what I hope to do.
          </p>
        
          <p>So thatâ€™s where I am now. </p>
        
          <p>Last summer, I hosted a pop-up burger shop for fun. I really like screaming, wandering around, laughing, and meeting people. I also love Acid Trip by Rejjie Snow and The Anthropocene Reviewed by John Greene. <font color = "#3883FF"><b>I write about my life, projects, and other stuff here.</b></font></p>
